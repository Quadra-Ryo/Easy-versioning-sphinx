# Official Documentation Easy_Versioning v2.0 ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡³

## Project Overview  

Tired of spending hours manually configuring version and language management in your Sphinx documentation?  
So was I. Thatâ€™s why I created **Easy_Versioning**, the simplest and most intuitive versioning tool available.  

With minimal setup and a single terminal command, Easy_Versioning automatically adds everything you need to manage versions and languages in your Sphinx project.  
The result? Fully prepared documentation, ready to deploy, including a handy `.bat` file that starts a local Python server to preview your site in seconds directly in your favorite browser.  

## What the tool does:  
 - A customizable form for managing versions and languages (or a default form if the `"/data"` folder or `"/data/footer.md"` file is not provided).  
 - Full control over deployment: the generated site is hosted directly on your server, with no reliance on external services like RTD (Read the Docs).  
 - No registration, accounts, or fees required: open-source and free for public, private, commercial, or non-commercial projects.  

## Why these choices:  
- Greater control over your documentationâ€™s performance.  
- Zero additional costs or usage fees.  
- Freedom to adapt the site to your specific needs without limitations.  

In short, **Easy_Versioning** was created to follow Sphinxâ€™s philosophy: making complex tasks simple. Itâ€™s designed for developers who want full control over their projects without relying on third-party platforms or paid services.
