# Easy Versioning (Sphinx documentation build tool)
  
This tool was created to address the need to add **versioning to a Sphinx** project without relying on Read the Docs (RTD).  
  
This Python script automates the full workflow of **preparing, versioning, building, and organizing documentation from Markdown** files using the Sphinx tool.  

It’s designed for teams and organizations who want to **self-host** their documentation sites and prefer full control over the hosting environment and theme customization.  
Easy Versioning works as an **alternative approach** for managing versioned and multilingual docs, complementing existing Sphinx workflows in a simple way with only one tool.

By organizing your source files in the expected structure, this tool actively builds your documentation with Sphinx and outputs a fully ready-to-deploy static site.  
With minimal setup, it streamlines the process of managing multiple versions and languages, adding consistent footers, and arranging build artifacts for deployment.

You can find a fully working example of a `Footer.md` file in the `Example/data` folder of this project.  
You can start by copying the default file in your `data/` folder and then customize it as you wish by modifying the CSS.  
If you want to create your own `Footer.md` file, please follow the placeholder tags as shown in the example in the folder.

<br>

Inside the `src/` folder, place all your documentation projects you want to build organized according to the directory structure shown above.

You can find a complete example project in the `Example/` folder, which you can download, build, and use as a setup for your own project!

## How to use it

By downloading the `Example/` folder in this repository, you can access the official Easy_versioning documentation.   
It includes detailed guides in Italian, English, and German, additionally, you can test the final output, as the documentation itself was built using this tool.  

You can find a simple and easy documentation below:   

The tool requires the directory structure shown above.  
After opening a terminal in the project’s source directory (which contains the `data/` and `src/` folders), run the command `easy_versioning_build`.

This command can be run without any arguments, or with up to two arguments:

1. **Default language:** The fallback language and the main language of the project (default is "English"). If no arguments are provided, make sure there is an "English" folder in every version of the documentation. Choose a language that exists in **all** versions of your documentation.  
2. **Cleanup flag:** A boolean flag (default is True) that controls whether the `_source` directory is removed from the final build to reduce the project size.  
   - Set this flag to `0` to disable cleanup and keep the `_source` directory.

Examples:  
- `easy_versioning_build` — Uses English as the default language and removes the `_source` directory.  
- `easy_versioning_build Italiano 0` — Sets Italian as the default language and keeps the `_source` directory intact.
